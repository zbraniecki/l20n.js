L20n reinvents software localization. Users should be able to benefit from the 
entire expressive power of a natural language.  L20n keeps simple things 
simple, and at the same time makes complex things possible.


What L20n looks like
--------------------

A straight-forward example in English:

```php
<brandName "Firefox">
<about "About {{ brandName }}">
```

And the same thing in Polish:

```php
<brandName {
  nominative: "Firefox",
  genitive: "Firefoksa",
  dative: "Firefoksowi",
  accusative: "Firefoksa",
  instrumental: "Firefoksem",
  locative: "Firefoksie"
}>
<about "O {{ brandName.locative }}">
```

Visit [L20n by Example](http://l20n.org/learn) to learn more about L20n's 
syntax.


The JavaScript API
------------------

```javascript
var ctx = L20n.getContext();
ctx.linkResource('./locales/strings.l20n');
ctx.freeze();
```

When you freeze the context, the resource files will be retrieved, parsed and 
compiled.  You can listen to the `ready` event (emitted by the `Context` 
instance when all the resources have been compiled) and use `ctx.get` and 
`ctx.getEntity` to get translations synchronously.

Alternatively, you can register callbacks to execute when the context is ready 
(or when globals change and translations need to be updated) with 
`ctx.localize`.

```javascript
ctx.localize(['hello', 'new'], function(l10n) {
  var node = document.querySelector('[data-l10n-id=hello]');
  node.textConent = l10n.entities.hello.value;
  node.classList.remove('hidden');
});
```

### ctx.registerLocales(String[, Stringâ€¦])

Register the locales (language codes) passed as the arguments.

```javascript
ctx.registerLocales('es-AR', 'es-ES', 'en-US');
```

The list of locales should be the result of a client-side language negotiation 
between the HTML document and the browser.  It should include the original 
language of the document as the last element.

If `registerLocales` is called with a non-empty list of arguments, the Context 
instance will run in a multi-locale mode.  In this mode, the language fallback 
is enabled according to the negotiated fallback chain.  Each entity retrieved 
via `getEntity` or `localize` will also have a `locale` property denoting which 
language it is in.  (E.g., in the example above, if an entity is missing from 
`es-AR` and is found in `es-ES`, the `locale` property will be `es-ES`.)

If, on the other hand, `registerLocales` is called with an empty argument list, 
with a falsy argument or is not called at all, the Context instance will run in 
a single-locale mode.  In this mode there is no language negotiation nor 
language fallback.  All resources are added to a special locale internally 
called `\_\_none\_\_` and all retrieved entities come from it as well (their 
`locale` property is `undefined`).

`registerLocales` can be called after `freeze` to change the current language 
fallback chain, for instance if requested by the user.


### ctx.addResource(String)

Add a string as the content of a resource to the Context instance. 

```javascript
ctx.addResource('<hello "Hello, world!">');
```

The resource is added to all registered locales, or to the `\_\_none\_\_` 
locale in the single-locale mode.


### ctx.linkResource(String)

Add a resource identified by a URL to the Context instance. 

```javascript
ctx.linkResource('../locale/app.lol');
```

The resource is added to all registered locales, or to the `\_\_none\_\_` 
locale in the single-locale mode.


### ctx.linkResource(Function)

Add a resource identified by a URL to the Context instance.  The URL is 
constructed dynamically when you call `freeze`.  The function passed to 
`linkResource` (called a _template function_) takes one argument which is the 
code of the current locale, which needs to be first registered with 
`registerLocales`.

```javascript
ctx.linkResource(function(locale) {
  return '../locales/' + locale + '/app.lol';
});
```

The resource is added to all registered locales.  If there are no registered 
locales, calling `freeze` with a template function as an argument will throw 
a `No registered locales` error in `freeze`.


### ctx.freeze()

Freeze the Context instance.  No more resources can be added after `freeze` is 
called.

All IO related to fetching the resource files takes place in `freeze`.  When 
all resources have been fetched, parsed and compiled, the Context instance will 
emit a `ready` event.


### ctx.addEventListener(String, Function)

Register the specified listener on Context it's called on.

First argument is an event type to listen for.

Currently available are:
`ready` - fired when Context resources are available and it is ready to use.

This event is also fired after each change to locale order (retranslation).

`error` - fired when Context encounters an error like:
 - entity could not be retrieved
 - entity could not be found
 - entity value could not be computed

`debug` - exposes access to internal errors from parser and compiler

### ctx.removeEventListener(String, Function)

Remove the event listener previously registered with addEventListener.

### ctx.removeEventListener(String, Function)
### ctx.get(String, Object)
### ctx.getEntity(String, Object)
### ctx.localize(Array&lt;String&gt;, Function)
### ctx.ready(Function)


The HTML Bindings
-----------------

You can take advantage of HTML bindings to localize your HTML documents with 
L20n.  See [bindings/README][].

[bindings/README]: https://github.com/l20n/l20n.js/blob/master/bindings/README.md


Install L20n in Node.js (using NPM)
-----------------------------------

    npm install l20n

Or, if you want to hack on L20n, install from source:

    git clone https://github.com/l20n/l20n.js.git
    cd l20n.js
    sudo npm link
    cd ../some/other/project
    npm link l20n

In your other project you can now require L20n:

    var L20n = require('l20n');
    var ctx = L20n.getContext();


Build L20n for the Clientside
-----------------------------

In order to use L20n on a webpage, all you need is an optimized to a single 
file, and possibly minified, version of the library.

    git clone https://github.com/l20n/l20n.js.git
    cd l20n.js
    npm install
    make build

This will produce the optimized files in `dist`.

    dist/l20n.js
    dist/l20n.min.js

Include the optimized script in your webpage to make the `L20n` object global.

```html
<script src="../path/to/dist/l20n.js"></script>
<script>
  var ctx = L20n.getContext();
</script>
```

For resource file loading over XHR to work properly, remember to run your 
webpage on a server (localhost will do).


Set up L20n for Development
---------------------------

If you want to hack on L20n locally, you don't have to `make build` after every 
edit.  L20n follows the AMD naming scheme and can be used with module loaders 
like [RequireJS][].

[RequireJS]: http://requirejs.org/

```html
<script src="require.js"></script>
<script>
  require.config({ 
    baseUrl: '../path/to/lib/', // tell RequireJS where to look for L20n
    paths: {
      'l20n/platform': 'client/l20n/platform'
    }
  });
  require(['l20n'], function(L20n) {
    var ctx = L20n.getContext();
    // write the rest of your code here
  });
</script> 
```
