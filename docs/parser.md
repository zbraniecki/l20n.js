# Parser

The `Parser` class is responsible for parsing FTL resources.

It's only public method is `getResource(source)` which takes an FTL
string and returns a two element Array with FTL AST
generated from the source as the first element and an array of L10nError
objects as the second.

This parser is aiming for generating full AST which is useful for FTL tools.

There is an equivalent of this parser in ftl/entries/parser which is meant
for runtime performance and generates an optimized entries object.
