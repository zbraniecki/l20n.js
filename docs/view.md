The View API
============

The main abstraction used by the JavaScript API is the `View` class.  Views are 
responsible for localizing `document` objects in HTML.  Internally, viewes use 
the `Service` class to store the state of the language negotiation and to cache 
downloaded resources.

If you're using the `web` or the `webcompat` runtime builds (see 
[docs/html][]), each `document` will have its corresponding `View` created 
automatically on startup, as `document.l10n`.

[docs/html]: html.md


View (document.l10n)
--------------------

### view.ready

A Promise which resolves when the `document` fires `DOMLocalized`.  It's often 
more convenient to use this than to listen to the event because you don't need 
to also check if the event has already fired (via the `document.localized` 
property).

```javascript
view.ready.then(App.init);
```

### view.languages

A Promise which resolves to the array of the current user-preferred languages.  
Language objects have the following properties:

```javascript
{
  code: 'ar',
  dir: 'rtl',
  src: 'app'
}
```

Language codes follow [BCP 47][].  Direction can be `ltr` or `rtl`.  Source is 
`app` for languages bundled with the application, `extra` for languages from 
language packages and `qps` for pseudo-languages.

[BCP 47]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47

```javascript
view.languages.then(
  langs => console.log(langs));
// ['pl', 'en-US']
```

You can also trigger the language negotation by assigning an array of language 
codes.

```javascript
view.languages = ['de-DE', 'de', 'en-US'];
```


### view.format(id, args)

Retrieve the translation corresponding to the `id` identifier.

If passed, `args` is a simple hash object with a list of variables that will be 
interpolated in the value of the translation.

Returns a Promise resolving to the Entity object.

```javascript
view.format('hello', { who: 'world' }).then(
  entity => console.log(entity));
// -> { value: 'Hello, world!', attrs: null }
```

Use this sparingly for one-off messages which don't need to be retranslated 
when the user changes their language preferences.


### view.setAttributes(elem, id, args)

Set the `data-l10n-id` and `data-l10n-args` attributes on DOM elements.

L20n makes use of mutation observers to detect changes to `data-l10n-*`
attributes and translate elements asynchronously.  `setAttributes` is 
a convenience method which allows to translate DOM elements declaratively.

You should always prefer to use `data-l10n-id` on elements (statically in HTML 
or dynamically via `setAttributes`) over manually retrieving translations with 
`format`.  The use of attributes ensures that the elements can be retranslated 
when the user changes their language preferences.

```javascript
view.setAttributes(
  document.querySelector('#welcome'), 'hello', { who: 'world' });
```

This will set the following attributes on the `#welcome` element.  L20n's 
MutationObserver will pick up this change and will localize the element 
asynchronously.

```html
<p id='welcome' data-l10n-id='hello' data-l10n-args='{"who": "world"}'></p> 
```


### view.getAttributes(elem)

Get the `data-l10n-*` attributes from DOM elements.

```javascript
view.getAttributes(
  document.querySelector('#welcome'));
// -> { id: 'hello', args: { who: 'world' } }
```


### view.translateFragment(frag)

Translate a DOM node or fragment asynchronously.

You can manually trigger translation (or re-translation) of a DOM fragment with 
`translateFragment`.  Use the `data-l10n-id` and `data-l10n-args` attributes to 
mark up the DOM with information about which translations to use.

Returns a Promise.
